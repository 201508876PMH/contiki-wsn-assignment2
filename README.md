# Data Compression using Discrete Cosine Transform in TelosB Mote/Cooja
In this assignment, data compression using discrete cosine transform (DCT) will be studied for the time-series signals. For testing electrocardiogram (ECG) signals will be used. DCT-II transform of a length N signal x is given as,

# Goal
The goal of this assignment is to implement DCT transform in the TelosB mote in an energy-efficient way for time series data.
Tasks to be completed are:
- Implement and measure the execution time and energy consumption for the fol- lowing cases:
  - N = 256 and M = 75.
  - N = 512 and M = 120.
- Measure the mean square error between the original signal and reconstructed signal for both the cases.

# Results N = 256 and M = 75
# Results N = 512 and M = 120
